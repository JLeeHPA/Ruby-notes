# Ruby-notes
This repository holds my notes for the Ruby programming language. It can be forked over to the main HPA Bastion project for future developers as well.

All files were written in Jupyter-Notebook using the Anaconda distribution. More information about Anaconda cna be found here: https://anaconda.org/

Gems required are:
- iruby
- ffi-rzmq

The notebooks should be read in the following order:
